# Sorting Visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort

## Features

1. **Colored Representation of Steps Being Executed**
   - **Blue**: Default
   - **Yellow**: Being compared
   - **Red**: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
   - **Green**: In correct position

2. **Controls for Visualizations**
   - Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
   - Data size
   - Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data)

3. **Complexity**
   - Time and space complexity of the algorithm being visualized.
